1) Project Name: FEATURE EXTRACTION AND PRICE PREDICTION FOR MOBILE PHONES
   
2) Description: This project is related to all the features of a mobile phone like its model, colour, memory, RAM, battery capacity, rear camera, front camera, presence of AI lens,  mobile height,
   processor and most importantly, the Price. And we need to do its Data exploration, Data preprocessing like Missing values, Outliers, Ordinal encoding. Then we have done its Feature extraction like
   the most relevant features which affect the Price. This was done by Correlation Analysis and many other methods. Then we was to build the model by using many algorithms like Linear Regression,
   Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Also we used Model Evaluation methods like mean absolute error, root mean squared error to assess how accurately it predicts mobile phone prices.
   
3) Dependencies: The versions and libraries which have been used are:
   a)  numpy
   b) pandas
   c) matplotlib
   d) seaborn
   e) sklearn
   
4) Configuration: A csv file was imported for this purpose and after cleaning the data and its preprocessing before using algorithms, a csv file was made and saved and exported for Tableau purpose.

5) Testing: Many statistical methods like dimensionality reduction and visualizations have been used and then splitted the data for training and testing sets.

6) Deployment: Gradient Boosting Regression method has been used for final model.

7) Front Camera, Model, Memory, Battery and Processor are the features which affect price the most.

8) Troubleshooting: Many many errors were there while solving all the data and applying all the functions but all those were solved by searching in google.

9) Code Style: Very very simple coding has been used according to the demand of this data like replace function, lambda function etc.

10) Roadmap: This is first project in which we used algorithms and built a model. Hope to solve many more projects and more algorithms like this.

11) Security: This repository is public and Tableau is also public.

12) Credits: All credits goes to Shweta Mam and our Faculty Arun Sir.
